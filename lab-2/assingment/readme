Write the Deck class. 
Deck is a collection of Card references stored in an ArrayList. 
Each of the Card references in the ArrayList will refer to some type of Card object. 
If you are playing BlackJack, the Card references will refer to BlackJackCard objects.
If you were playing Poker, the Card references might be referring to PokerCard objects.
The Deck class could be used for any card game.
Show that Deck works as intended by instantiating a Deck in the main and displaying all of the shuffled cards in the debug window.
