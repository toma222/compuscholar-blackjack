Write a Dealer class that extends the Player class. Show that Dealer works
as intended by instantiating a Dealer in the game class and using the Dealer to play a game of
BlackJack.

You are writting the dealer class

---- CHECKLIST ----

Dealer.java
    - Constructor
    - shuffle
    - deal
    - hit
        - the dealer hit function does not require user input
            only hit if the hand value of the dealer below 18


---- TEST OUTPUT ----

I cant really write a test output because the deck is shuffled randomly

However I can tell you that what should happen is the dealer and the player both get
two cards, then the game determines who won.

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WRITE THE CODE TO DETERMINE WHO WINS; THAT CODE IS IN THE DealerTestOne.java FILE.
