# compuscholar-blackjack

This is meant to be a porting of the compu-scholar blackjack assignment to
a "Mr.Deere" sort of github assignment


how this should work is that for each "lab" there are 2 folders: assignment and answers.
The folder named assignment should have a readme with a Mr.Deere-esq type assignment. I understand that
there is an issue with people not understanding what to implement, so I have added a checklist to the readme that should clear things up.
I would recommend doing the assignment folder instead of just copying the code from the answer folder into compuscholar, so that
you still learn all the concepts.


But unfortunately, you do have free will.
