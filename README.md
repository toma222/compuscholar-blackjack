# compuscholar-blackjack

This is meant to be a porting of the compu-scholar blackjack assignment to
a "Mr.Deere" sort of github assignment
<br>
how this should work is that for each "lab" there are 2 files: assignment and answers.
The folder that says assignment should have a readme with a Mr.Deere-equ type assignment.
I would recommend doing the assignment folder instead of just copying the code from the answer folder.

But of unfortunately you have free will.
